"""
This is a simple example of a client program written in Python.
Again, this is a very basic example to complement the 'basic_server.c' example.


When testing, start by initiating a connection with the server by sending the "init" message outlined in 
the specification document. Then, wait for the server to send you a message saying the game has begun. 

Once this message has been read, plan out a couple of turns on paper and hard-code these messages to
and from the server (i.e. play a few rounds of the 'dice game' where you know what the right and wrong 
dice rolls are). You will be able to edit this trivially later on; it is often easier to debug the code
if you know exactly what your expected values are. 

From this, you should be able to bootstrap message-parsing to and from the server whilst making it easy to debug.
Then, start to add functions in the server code that actually 'run' the game in the background.
